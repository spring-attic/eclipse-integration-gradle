<h1>Gradle STS Support -- 2.9.0 -- Tutorial</h1>

<p class="note">Note: The latest version of this file can always be
found <a href="https://static.springsource.org/sts/docs/latest/reference/html/gradle/">here</a></p>

<p>This tutorial will take you through the process of using the STS-Gradle
tooling to import a Gradle multi-project into STS and execute some
Gradle tasks on the imported project(s). This tutorial does not cover
how to install the Gradle tooling into STS.</p>

<p>We will use <a href="https://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/">spring-security
project</a> as a running example throughout this tutorial.</p>

<p class="note">Note: There is also an <a href="https://static.springsource.org/sts/docs/2.7.0.M1/reference/html/gradle/gradle-sts-tutorial.html">older
version of this tutorial</a> based on the spring-integration project.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along, the first step is to checkout the <a href="https://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/source.html">source
code</a> from git:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">git clone git://git.springsource.org/spring-security/spring-security.git</pre>

<p>This will create the "spring-security" folder directly below
whatever directory you typed the command in.</p>

<h2><a name="import"></a>Importing Existing Gradle Project(s)</h2>

<p>Now that we have the source code checked out we can use the <b>Gradle Import Wizard</b> to import a
subset of the spring-security projects into an Eclipse workspace.</p>

<p>This wizard is accessible via the <b>"File
&gt;&gt; Import ..." menu</b>.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 525px; height: 550px;" alt="Choose Gradle import wizard" src="img/choose-gradle-wizard.png"></div>

<p>The first thing you have to do in the wizard is point it to the root
folder of your Gradle project. Click the <b>"Browse" button </b>and find the
folder, or simply enter the path to your project folder if you remember
it. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/import-wizard-1.png"></div>

<p>A typical Gradle project may consist of a hierarchy of (sub)projects.
Before you can select which (sub)projects you are interested in you
must request the Gradle API to construct a Gradle project/sub-project
structure model. Click the <b>"Build
Model" button</b> to do this.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 596px; height: 723px;" alt="" src="img/import-wizard-building-model.png"></div>

<p><b>Warning:</b> This may take some time, so be patient!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building the model may take some time. How much time depends on
the complexity of your project and how many of the build script's
dependencies can already be found in the cache.</li>
    <li>For spring-security, an initial "Build Model" with a
completely cleared .gradle cache may take a few minutes to complete.</li>
   </ul>

<p>After some time, once the model has been constructed, you will be able
to select which projects you wish to import into the workspace. You
could elect to import everything by clicking the <b>"Select All" Button</b>. 
However, let's assume we are only interested in the "spring-security-samples-jaas"
project.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/import-jaas-sample.png"></div>

<p>If a project is selected and that project has an inter-project
dependency on another project, then this other project must also be
imported. Otherwise, the imported project would have problems with its
classpath (missing dependencies). The import wizard uses the project
dependency information provided by the Gradle tooling API to check
whether you have properly selected all required projects. In the
screenshot above, a missing dependency on "spring-security-web" is
detected and reported.</p>
<p>To fix it, select the missing project (but another missing dependency
will be reported) or use the quick and easy <b>"Select required" button</b>
which will automatically select required projects based on your current selection.</p>


<p>You may or may not want to import the root project (usually
it contains the main build script). If you
click the root project, you will notice that it automatically
selects/deselects all the subprojects below it. If you just want to select the root project alone, you can uncheck the <b>"Auto-select subprojects"</b> option.<br>
</p>
Allthough it is possible to do so, <span style="font-weight: bold;">we will not select the root project</span>
to import. We can always come back later and import additional
projects, including the root project. So it is beneficial to only import the projects you require
(fewer imported projects means speedier workspace builds and less clutter).<br>
<h2>Import options:&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Besides selecting which projects to import, 
the wizard also provides
some additional options.<b><br>
</b></p>

<h3>Run before / after</h3>

<p>These options allow the execution of specific gradle tasks to aid in
the initialization of imported projects. When enabled, the wizard will
execute the given tasks on each imported project that defines the task(s).</p>

<p>Some default values are provided to support two common use cases. </p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use case 1: execute cleanEclipse eclipse before importing<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 297px; height: 63px;" alt="" src="img/run-before.png"></div>

<br>
The reason why you may want to do this is because at present the Gradle
Tooling API only directly supports
basic Java projects. If we were to rely only on the information
provided by the Tooling API in importing this project, then none of the WTP/Web related STS functionality will be turned on.<br>
<br>
To remedy this, simply enable the "Run Before" option to run "cleanEclipse"
and "eclipse" tasks as shown above. The tasks will generate the necessary
configuration files for WTP, and the import wizard is smart enough to leave the
WTP related information untouched when adding its own customizations.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note 1:</span> In Gradle M3, a Tooling
API bug prevents STS from determining whether the tasks are defined on
any given project. This may lead to an error trying to execute the
tasks when they are not defined. To avoid this bug you have a few
options:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Do not enable running the before tasks (but you will only get a 'pure Java' project).<br>
</li>
  <li>Ensure the tasks are defined on all the projects you want to import.</li>
  <li>Switch your gradle wrapper to a more recect version of Gradle (The bug is fixed in M4).<br>
</li>
  <li>Run cleanEclipse and eclipse tasks on the commandline before importing.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note 2:</span> If the imported project
uses Gradle M4 or above, the 'run before' option will be turned on by
default. There should be no harm from having it enabled (except, that
it will take slightly longer to peform the import operation)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use case 2: execute afterEclipseImport task<br>
</span><br>
This task is intended as an open-ended hook. It is up to you to define
this task in your build-script to make any kind of customization you
might want. This option is enabled by default, however, unless some
imported project actually define the task it won't do anything. (Note
that 'afterEclipseImport' is not a built-in eclipse-plugin task, so it
is not affected by the aforementioned bug).<br>
<br>
It is recommended to leave this option on by default. If the task is
indeed defined, it is probably the project developer's intention that
it be executed on import. Conversely, if it is not defined the Wizard
will be able to detect this and simply will not do anything.<br>

<h3>Enable Dependency Management</h3>

<p>Enabling this option means that STS will configure your project's dependencies
based on information it obtains from calling the Gradle Tooling API.
The center piece of this mechanism is a special 'Gradle Dependencies' classpath entry.
The contents of this entry will be computed dynamically by calling on the
Gradle Tooling API. This option is recommended for projects that are
fully supported by the tooling API. At present this means 'pure' Java 
projects, or in Eclipse terms: projects that only require the Java nature.</p>

<p>The advantage of using this option is that your project's .classpath 
file will be free of user-specific references to files in the user's
Gralde cache. Thus, it is viable to consider checking in files like
.classpath into source control.</p>

<p>Thus also, enabling dependency management should be the default. Unfortunately,
due to the limited nature of the current Gradle Tooling API, this option may not
work well for many projects. If so, you may consider disabling the
option and relying directly on your build script and the Gradle eclipse
plugin's 'cleanEclipse' and 'eclipse' tasks to configure your projects on
import instead.</p>

<p>Since 2.9.0, STS explicitly attempts to provide good support for this scenario.
If dependency management is disabled then STS will not add the 'Gradle Dependencies' 
entry, nor will it configure source folders or dependencies between projects.
Instead, you should select some tasks (typically 'cleanEclipse eclipse' to
execute before import instead.</p>

<p>When dependency management is disabled, of course most of the menu
commands related to dependency management will then be
disabled. However since 2.9.0, the <b>Refresh All</b> command now provides 
an alternate implementation for just this case. The alternate implementation 
uses information captured and stored in <tt>.settings/gradle</tt> during import.
This allows <b>Refresh All</b> to essentially re-import your project inplace. 
That is, the same before/after tasks will be re-executed, and the same set 
of selected customizations are re-applied to your project. Assuming that 
'cleanEclipse eclipse' is amongst the selected before tasks, the effect 
of this is that all of your project's Eclipse configuration data
is refreshed.</p>

<p>Note that if dependency managment is disabled, your generated <tt>.classpath</tt> 
file will not be suitable to share with other users via a source code repository.
This is because it will typically contain references to files in the your local 
Gradle cache. Therefore, you should devise a process where each user generates their own
<tt>.classpath</tt> (and other Eclipse/STS config files) locally.</p>

<p>A file which you may still want to consider committing to source control in 
these scenarios is<br>
<tt>${rootproject}/.settings/gradle/org.springsource.ide.eclipse.gradle.core.import.prefs"</tt></p>

<p>This file contains the most important configuration options for the import
Wizard. If the file is present the import wizard will use it to set the
defaults accordingly. So if your project 
requires a set of very specific options to correctly import into STS, then
sharing this file can help taking the the guess work out of the import 
process. The contents of this file has been purposefully 
designed to be used in this fashion. It should only contain information that 
is safe to share amongst users (e.g. it does not contain absolute paths 
specific to one user's local file system).</p>

<h3>Enable DSL Support</h3>

<p>Enabling this option will enable DSL support in the Groovy Editor.
What this means is that, if  you have Groovy Eclipse installed, 
you will get a modicum of Gradle awareness while editing <tt>.gradle</tt>
files. I.e. simple code assist and JavaDoc style hover's for
some elements in your build script will be provided.</p>

<p>Selecting this option will enable DSL support for all the imported
projects at once. If you only want to enable it for selected 
projects. Then you should disable the option in the wizard and enable 
it for individual projects afterwards via "Gradle >> Enable DSL" menu. </p>

<h3>Create resource filters</h3>

<p>Enabling this option will add resource filters to the
imported projects to "hide" nested projects from the parent project.</p>

<p>This deserves some further explanation. Eclipse (and
therefore STS) essentially does not support project hierarchies. Only a
"flat" project structure is supported in Eclipse and projects can not
contain other projects.</p>

<p>To overcome this limitation, a Gradle project hierarchy is flattened
into a list of Eclipse projects. The projects will be imported as
"linked projects" so that nesting structure is still maintained in the
file system structure of the imported projects. However, if you import
both a parent and (some of) its children in this way, it will appear as
if the resources (files and folders) in the children are present
multiple times in the workspace: once in the child itself and also once
inside a nested folder of the parent project that contains the child.
Although Eclipse supports this kind of setup, and it is possible to
work with workspaces that show the same underlying file aliassed in
multiple locations in the Eclipse workspace, it can be confusing.<br>
</p>
<p>For example if you pressed "CTRL-SHIFT-R" to "open resource" and
searched for one of these aliassed resources, you would see that
resource appear multiple times. To avoid this, keep the "create
resource filters" enabled. This will configure the parent project in
such a way that the children's project's resources are treated as
"invisible/non-existent" in the parent. <b><br>
</b></p>
<h3><b>Use hierarchical project names</b><br>
</h3>
<p>This option selects between two different project naming schemes.<br>
</p>
<p>Names of the imported Eclipse projects can be chosen
freely by the user. Since the projects are represented as links to the
actual file system location, the names of the projects don't affect the
underlying project structure. Of course, choosing sensible names will
help in remembering what each Eclipse project represents in terms of
the Gradle project hierarchy!<br>
</p>
<p>The wizard will give an initial name to each imported project based on
one of two naming schemes. This choice <b>only affects the initial names</b> assigned by
the wizard, you can still rename the projects after importing them.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">hierarchical</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">: </span>the name of each project consists
of the name of each ancestor in the path leading to the project and the
project itself, separated by dots. For example the
"spring-integration-test" project would get Eclipse name
"spring-integration.spring-integration-test" in the hierarchical naming
scheme.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">non-hierarchical: </span>only
the name of the project itself (not its parents) is used. For example
"spring-integration-test" will be imported as a project called
"spring-integration-test".<br>
</p>
It is possible that the non-hierarchical naming scheme leads to name
conflicts (if more than one project in the hierarchy has the same
name). The wizard will detect this situation and signal it as an error.
If you see this error you will can use the hierarchical scheme
instead, or you can deselect some of the projects that cause the naming conflict.<br>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> It is recommended you do not use this option if you are relying on you are 
using the 'eclipse' gradle task to help configure the project. The reason for this is that Gradle won't know
about the fact that STS is renaming the project's. Thus any gradle generated configuration that contains 
references to project names may not work well together with the hierarchical naming scheme.</p>

<h3>Create working set 'spring-security'<br></h3>

<p>This creates a working set based on the root
project's name and adds all imported projects to this workingset. If the working set already exists this option will say
"add" instead of "create". It will still add the projects to this
workingset, but, since it already exists, won't try to create it again.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<h3>Additional working sets<br>
</h3>
<p>This provides a similar UI to the standard Eclipse
import wizard for adding projects to working sets. It allows you to add
the imported projects to an arbitrary number of working sets. You can
use this instead of (or in conjunction with) the previous option. The
previous option is more convenient and quick (in terms of numbers of
clicks and keystrokes required) but if you need more control over the
working sets and/or their names, this UI is provided as a more general
fall-back option.<br>
</p>
<h2>Performing the Import<br>
</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we leave everything at the default settings,
except for the 'run before' option which we explicitly enable since we
want to have correct configuration for the WTP aspects of the sample
web project.</p>
<blockquote>
    <br>
    <img alt="" src="img/import-finish.png"><br>
  </blockquote>
Once you click finish, the selected projects will be imported into the
Eclipse workspace.<br>

<h2><a name="dependencies"></a>Imported Project Auto-configuration</h2>

<p>Depending on selected opton. The import wizard will automatically configured
projects as follows.</p>

<p>In all cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <b>Gradle Nature</b> is added to each project (shown in the UI
as a bold, green "G" overlayed in the bottom right corner of the
project icon).</li>
</ul>

<p>If dependency management is <b>enabled</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A Gradle <b>class path container</b> is added to dynamically compute
         the project's binary "jar" dependencies.</li>
  <li>The project's <b>source folders</b> are configured</li>
  <li>dependencies between projects are configured as Eclipse <b>project dependencies</b></li>
</ul>

<p>If dependency management is <b>disabled</b> then these configurations will not
be automatically applied. Instead, it is assumed that you have defined and 
selected appropriate <b>run before/after</b> gradle tasks to 
achieve a similar effect.</p>

<p>If DSL support is enabled, the following additions will be made to your project's configuration:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Groovy Nature</li>
   <li>Gradle DSLD classpath entry added</li>
   <li>Groovy Libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this turns your project into a Groovy project. Because of
limitations in both AJDT and Greclipse, DSLD support can not be enabled
for AspectJ projects. If you attempt to do so, an error will be reported
during import and the DSL support will not be added to any affected projects. 
However,  the import should still proceed and no other ill effects should result 
from this error.</p>
 
<p>The sceenshot below shows the workspace right after the import finished: </p>
 /ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 855px; height: 598px;" alt="" src="img/ws-right-after-import.png"></div>
  <ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <br>
A few things are worth noting:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>You will probably notice a background job (bottom right of
the workspace window) called "Update Gradle Classpath Container". The
Gradle classpath container is an Eclipse class path entry representing
all the binary project dependencies (typically these are jar files
downloaded to your Gradle cache folder). This job may take a long time
to complete, especially right after the first import, because it is
downloading all the dependencies into the Gradle cache folder. This
initial update may take several minutes.</li>
      <li>The current implementation of the Gradle tooling API does not
provide good progress information (yet), so if you examine the Job
queue more
closely, you may notice that sometimes it appears as if the job's
progress bar is
stuck. Be patient, it may take several minutes but the Job should
eventually complete. Subsequent updates should be much faster since the
dependencies are already downloaded.</li>
      <li>Eclipse, by default, does not show working sets in the
package explorer. If you want to use workingsets to organize projects
in your workspace, you can enable this from the package explorer's
configuration menu (under the little triangle in the top-left corner of
the package explorer view, change "toplevel elements" from "projects"
into "workingsets").</li>
    <li>The ...-samples-jaas project has retained its WTP-related
configuration infos, as can be seen from its icon. You can also test
this out by deploying it to the server. (Menu: Run As &gt;&gt; Run On
Server).<br>
    </li>

    </ul>
    <br>
The screenshot below shows the package explorer view, with "workingsets
as toplevel elements" enabled, after the classpath container update has
completed. The "missing project" errors are now gone. The
screenshot also shows the downloaded <tt>.jar</tt> entries in the classpath
container (under "Gradle Dependencies").<br>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 252px; height: 389px;" alt="" src="img/expanded-classpath-container.png"><br>
  </div>
<h2>Refreshing Project Configuration Data</h2>

<p>Presently, the Gradle tooling API which we built upon does not tell us
when a Gradle project model needs to be updated. As a result, the
configuration
will become outdated. To force various aspects of the project
configuration to be recomputed you can invoke the commands in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gradle context menu </span>accessed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">right clicking </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">on the Gradle project</span>.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 744px; height: 788px;" alt="" src="img/gradle-context-menu.png"></div>
  <ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <br>
The <b>Gradle context menu</b> provides the following commands:<br>
    <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable(or enable)
dependency management: </span>Remove/add the Gradle class path
container from/to the project.<br>
      <blockquote>Removing the container means that you intend to take
personal responsibility for managing the project's dependencies and do
not want to have the Gradle tooling do it for you at all.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh Dependencies: </span>for
each of the selected projects (one or more Gradle projects can be
selected. All selected projects must have dependency management enabled)<br>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>Invalidate and request a new Gradle model from the
tooling
API</li>
          <li>Recompute the contents of the class path container</li>
          <li>Recompute and reconfigure project dependencies</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh Source Folders: </span>Like
Refresh Dependencies, but recomputes and reconfigures the project's
source folders.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Refresh All:</b>combination of Refresh Dependencies and Refresh Source Folders.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <p>Note that dependencies between projects and source folder
configuration are
stored in your project's metadata (the .classpath file). This means
they
will persist across Eclipse sessions. </p>
    <p>Since 2.7.M2 the contents of the classpath container is also
persisted in your workspace metadata. This reduces the time it takes
for the IDE to become responsive when it starts up. However, it means
you may need to manually trigger a refresh once in a while. You can
tell whether a container
was initialized from persisted state because it will be labeled as
"Gradle Dependencies (persisted)".<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p><img style="width: 274px; height: 54px;" alt="" src="img/persisted-container.png"><br>
      </p>
    </ul></ul>
<h2>Importing Additional Projects</h2>
<p>The import wizard is designed to support importing a subset of
subprojects first and, later on, import additional projects as needed.</p>


<p>For example, earlier on we decided not to import the root project.
Let's say we want to import it now, so we can easily examine and edit
the main build script. <br>
</p>
<p>
To import additional projects, simply reopen the import wizard as before 
and point it again to the root of the project hierarchy. The project should already
be available from the project combo's pull-down history.<br>
</p>
<p>To import the root project in isolation, we deselect '"Auto-select
subprojects" and then select the root project, as shown below.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/import-root.png"><br>
</p>
Note that sub-projects that have previously been imported will not be
shown anymore (e.g. spring-security-core is no longer shown), since they can't be imported again. An exception to this
rule is made for projects that have subprojects themselves. Such
projects must
be shown because filtering them from the view would also implicitly
remove all their children (making it impossible to import their
children).<br>
<p>
    For example, if we would re-open the import wizard again after importing the root project, we would see this:<br>
  </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 183px; height: 108px;" alt="" src="img/import-again.png"></div>

<p>Note the root project's transparant look, indicating that it was already imported before.</p>
<h2><a name="launch"></a>The Task UI: "Launching" Gradle Tasks</h2>



<p>In the next section of this tutorial we'll walk through the UI for
creating and launching Gradle launch configurations. Gradle launch
configurations are provided as extensions to the standard Eclipse
launching framework. This means that if you are already familiar with
the Eclipse launch UI, most of this will be familiar to you.</p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating and Executing a Launch
Configuration</span><br>

<p>Before we can "launch" a list of Gradle tasks, we must create a launch
configuration. The easiest way to do that is by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Run As" context menu. </span>This menu is
accessed by right clicking on a Gradle project or one of its nested
resources in the Package Explorer.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 733px; height: 590px;" alt="" src="img/run-as-menu.png"><br>
  </div>
  <ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <br>
The following menu items will be shown (others may also be shown
depending on what exactly you right-clicked on).<br>
    <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Run As &gt;&gt; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gradle</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Build ...</span> (dots at the end)<br>
      <blockquote>This opens a Gradle launch configuration associated
with the
current project in the Tabbed launch configuration editor. This allows
you to examine and edit the configuration before launching it.<br>
If no launch configuration exists yet (for the selected project) an
empty one will be created automatically. If more than one configuration
is found, you will be asked to choose one.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Run As &gt;&gt; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gradle</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Build</span> (no dots at the end)<br>
      <blockquote>This attempts to directly launch a Gradle launch
configuration associated with your project. Typically you would use
this if you already have a launch configuration defined and want to
just launch it without examining or editing it. If a launch
configuration doesn't exist yet, however, one will be created and
opened
in the editor. If more than one
configuration already exists for the selected project, then a dialog
will popup to ask you to choose one.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">External Tools Configurations</span><br>
      <blockquote>This opens the generic Eclipse "External Tools
Configurations"
editor, allowing you to create / edit / save etc.
launch configurations of different types, including Gradle launch
configurations.<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
Since this is our first time launching anything for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">spring-integration</span> project, no
launch configuration exists yet. We right click on the root project's
build file (or any other resource in the project) and select "Run As
&gt;&gt; Gradle
Build...". An editor as shown in the screenshot below opens up. <br>
    <br>

If you have ever used ant launch configurations in Eclipse, the UI
should look familiar since we followed its design. The main difference
is that for Gradle the "list" of available tasks is a tree
rather than just a list. Leaf nodes in the tree are tasks that can be
executed. Internal tree nodes represent sub-projects.<br>
    <br>
The task tree can be quite large, especially for a project that has
many subprojects. To help in finding a task in a large tree you
can use the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">filter text" Box </span>above
the tree. Type in any text, and only the tasks with a name starting
with
this text will be shown. You can add a "*" to the front of your search
pattern to search for substrings instead of prefixes instead. The
screenshot below shows how we filtered the tree to only show "build"
related tasks. We then selected the "build" task in the root project.<br>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 642px; height: 785px;" alt="" src="img/task-filter-text.png"><br>
  </div>
  <ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Task execution order</span><br>
    <br>
If
multiple tasks are selected, the ordering of the tasks is often
important. For example, if we selected both ":clean" and ":build" in the jaas sample project, we
probably want to
make sure that the ":clean" task gets executed before the ":build" task.<br>
    <br>
The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> bottom portion of the "</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gradle</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Tasks" Tab </span>shows and controls task
execution order. To change the execution order click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Order..." Button</span>.<br>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 642px; height: 785px;" alt="" src="img/order-tasks.png"><br>
  </div>
  <ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <br>
Finally, after reordering the tasks as desired, click on the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "Run" Button</span> to save any changes
you have made and launch the configuration.<br>
Alternatively you can use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Apply"
Button</span> to save the configuration without launching; or the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Close" Button </span>to close it without
launching or saving.<br>
    <br>
After clicking "Run" the selected tasks will be executed and the
resulting output is displayed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse
console view</span>.<br>
    <br>

    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatically Refreshing the
Workspace after Task Execution</span></h3>
Typically, executing a set of Gradle tasks will cause changes to the
resources in your workspace. Eclipse, by default, will not become aware
of these changes. To make Eclipse aware that underlying resources in
the file system have changed you need to "refresh" the workspace, or at
least the portion of the workspace that you think may have changed. You
can do this manually by using the context menu of any resource in the
workspace. However, it is probably more convenient to automate this.<br>
    <br>
In the future the Gradle Task API aims to provide explicit information
to the IDE about potential workspace changes. Presently, however, this
is not the case and it is your
responsibility to either manually refresh the resources or
specify which resources should be
refreshed automatically. The Gradle launch configuration editor
provides a standard Eclipse "Refresh" tab to specify an automatic
refresh strategy.<br>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 730px; height: 494px;" alt="" src="img/refresh-tab.png"></div>
  <ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    <br>
To enable automatic refresh, check the<span style="font-weight: bold;">
"Refresh resources upon completion" Checkbox</span> and pick one of the
provided strategies.<br>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Relaunching an Existing
(Gradle)
Launch Configuration</span></h3>
After having created a launch configuration, you may want to launch
that same configuration again, either with or without changes.<br>
There are a number of different ways that you can do this. Besides
using the already discussed context menus, you can also use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">External Tools Toolbar button</span><br>
    <blockquote><img style="width: 227px; height: 134px;" alt="" src="img/toolbar.png"><br>
      <br>
    </blockquote>
You can either click on the toolbar button itself or use its pull-down
menu. <br>
The pull down menu gives you access to a<span style="font-weight: bold;">
list of recent launches</span> (automatically maintained) and a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> list of favorites</span> (explicitly
managed by you).<br>
    <br>
Clicking the button (instead of the pulldown) is a shortcut to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> relaunch the most recent entry in the
history</span>. <br>

<h2><a name="tasks-view">Gradle Tasks View</a></h2>

<p>The "Gradle Tasks" view added in STS 2.9.0.M1 provides an alternative mechanism that allows you to quickly launch a specific individual task without the hassle of using the standard Eclipse launch configuration editor.</p>

<p>To open the view, use the <b>Windows &gt;&gt; Show View</b> menu.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/show-view-other.png"></div>

<p>You will find the tasks view in the "Gradle" category.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/open-gradle-tasks-view.png"></div>

<p>The view allows you to select a Gradle project and shows the tasks available for that project. Double-clicking a task
in the view will launch that task.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/gradle-tasks-view.png"></div>

<p>The task view provides two buttons in its toolbar, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Link with Selection Button: when selected, this makes the tasks view automatically select the corresponding project whenever you select something in another view.</li>
  <li>Refresh button: click this to request the list of tasks to be refreshed (for example after you added new task definitions to your .gradle file).</li>
</ul>

<p>The tasks view provides a search box. Enter a string in this box to see only those tasks starting with that string. You can also add a "*" in front to search for substrings instead.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" src="img/tasks-view-with-filter.png"></div>

Behind the scenes the tasks view uses the same launching mechanism as described earlier. A launch configuration 
to launch your selected task will be created automatically if one does not already exist.
If it exists, the existing configuration will be reused. That means you will be able to use the tools described
earlier (launch configuration editor, launch history and shortcuts to edit and re-launch these configurations as well).

This release should still be considered
experimental. It has been tested with a few
real projects (spock, spring-integration, spring-security, spring-data-redis), but we are sure problems and
issues remain. We welcome feedback and bug
