<h2>FAQ</h2>


<h3><a name="a1"></a>What functionality is provided?</h3>


In a nutshell, we provide three main chunks of functionality <br>



<ol>
<li>An <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#import">import wizard</a>
to help you import Gradle projects / sub-projects into STS.</li><li>(Semi-)automated <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#dependencies">dependency
management</a><br>
  </li><li>An extension to the standard Eclipse launch framework to <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#launch">execute Gradle tasks</a>.<br>

  </li>
</ol>


For more details see the <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
It walks you through an example using the <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#import">import wizard </a>and the <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#launch">task execution UI</a>.<br>


<br>


The Gradle STS support is built upon a new tooling API that is being
developed as part of Gradle itself.&nbsp; As this brand new API is
fleshed out, the set of features in STS will expand.<br>



<h3><a name="a2"></a>What types of projects are supported?</h3>


The current version of the Gradle Tooling API only provides information
about the "Java" aspects of a project. That is, things such as the
classpath, project dependencies and source folders. The current version
of Gradle STS support therefore only explicitly provides support for
"plain Java" projects.&nbsp; In Eclipse terms, if your Eclipse project
only requires the Java project nature then it
is supported, otherwise it is not supported yet.<br>


<br>


You may still be able to use the tooling with other types of projects
(WTP, AspectJ, Groovy etc.) but this depends in large part on you
managing the non-Java related configuration of the project in some
other way yourself.<br>
<br>
A (somewhat experimental) method which is supported since 2.8.0.M2 to
get&nbsp; support for additional project types (WTP,&nbsp;
AspectJ,&nbsp; ...)&nbsp; is to execute the Gradle eclipse tasks before
importing.&nbsp; The import wizard provides this as an explicit option
and will do its best to preserve any additional information it finds
already existing in the project before making its own customizations.<br>
<h3><a name="a4"></a>My Java level (1.6 | 1.5) and libraries are not
setup right. Why
not?<br>
</h3>


The Gradle Tooling API does not (yet) tell us this information so we
cannot set it up automatically.<br>


<h3><a name="a5"></a>Is there support for editing ".gradle" files?</h3>

As of STS 2.9.0.M2 there is somewhat better support for editing .gradle files. 
This requires that you install a recent version of Groovy Eclipse (2.6.1 development
snapshot is required for STS 2.9.0.M2 gradle editor support). 
<p>
If a compatible version of Groovy Eclipse is installed, STS-Gradle will provide 
an option in its Gradle menu to 'Enable DSLD Support'. This will
add some customizations to your project to enable Groovy Eclipse on your project
and contribute a <a href="https://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/DSL+Descriptors+for+Groovy-Eclipse">DSL Descriptor</a>. 
This DSL Descriptor is currently quite limited and a work in progress. However you will already 
get some useful code-assist and JavaDoc hovers if it is turned on.
<p>
We know there is much work to be done here, and many clever things
are possible (e.g. content assisting for dependencies/version numbers
by using knowledge available from the selected dependency repository).<br>
<p>
Make sure to install a recent
version of Groovy Eclipse. Groovy-Eclipse can easily be installed from
the STS dashboard, or the most recent dev build via this update site
(Eclipse
3.7):<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>

<h3><a name="a6"></a>Why does importing a Gradle project take so long?</h3>


Longer version of this question: When I open the import wizard and
click the "Build Model" button, this seems to take a long time. Also,
it seems to download a lot of stuff. Why does it do that?<br>


<br>


Answer: Gradle needs to understand your project's structure to be able
to build the project/sub-project structure model. This means it needs
to
understand (at least to some degree) your gradle script. However, a
Gradle script is essentially a program. To understand this program
Gradle needs to download at least some of the dependencies that the
program itself relies upon. Unfortunately this takes time and can not
be avoided. If you have already been running gradle builds of your
project
outside of STS before importing the project, you will find it is pretty
quick
because the dependencies have all already been downloaded.
<h3><a name="a7"></a>Why does the progress bar behave funny?</h3>


The Gradle Tooling API upon which we built does not provide real
progress information (yet). The progress bar that you see is currently
just a guesstimate at progress information, almost more of a 'Yes, I am
still alive' monitor right now.
<h3><a name="a8"></a>Why can't I cancel any of the Gradle related
operations in STS?</h3>


The Gradle Tooling API upon which we built does not provide a way to
cancel long running operations (yet). <br>


<h3><a name="a9"></a>What versions of Gradle are supported?</h3>



Your build script will need to work with Gradle-1.0-M3 (or a more
recent version) to be able to use the Gradle STS tool support. This is
because we ship an embedded tooling API jar from 1.0-M4 and that is
what
it requires.<br>


<h3><a name="a10"></a>How do I import an existing Gradle project into
STS?</h3>


Probably the easiest way is to use the import wizard. It can be found
under "File &gt;&gt; Import" See the <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#import">tutorial for more details on
how to use it</a>.<br>


<h3><a name="a11"></a>How do I make STS update dependencies after I
edited my .gradle
file?</h3>


In the future, this will probably be automatic, however presently you
have to force a refresh manually by using one of the context menu items
in the "Gradle" menu, accessible by right clicking on your project. See
the <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html">tutorial for more info</a>.<br>


<h3><a name="a12"></a>How do I run a task?</h3>


Short answer: You can run a single task, or a list of tasks by using
the
"Run As &gt;&gt; Gradle Build..." menu, accessed by right clicking on
any resource in your gradle project.<br>


<br>


Long answer: There is a <a href="gradle-sts-tutorial.html#launch">detailed
explanation of the task UI</a> in the tutorial.<br>



<h3><a name="a13"></a>How do I debug a task?</h3>


The STS tools don't currently provide debugging support for launched
Gradle tasks.<br>


<h3><a name="a14"></a>How do I create a new Gradle project in STS? </h3>


The current version does not yet provide an explicit command or menu to
create a new Gradle project. However there are two ways to work around
this:<br>


<ol>
<li>create your project outside of STS and then import it using the
import wizard.</li><li>use the "new Java project wizard" to create a Java project.
Then use the "Configure &gt;&gt; Convert to Gradle Project" menu to
convert your project into a Gradle project (this adds the Gradle nature
and classpath container).<br>
  </li>
</ol>


If the project you are creating is a multi-project it is best to use
the
import wizard because the "Convert to Gradle project" will not import
the sub-projects into your workspace.<br>


<br>


Note that you can also use the import wizard to import a new
sub-project you just created inside an existing multi-project that is
already in your workspace.<br>


<h3><a name="why_flat"></a>Why is my project/sub-project hierachy
"flattened" by the import
wizard?</h3>


This is because Eclipse (and therefore STS) doesn't have the concept of
nested projects. We therefore translate the Gradle project hierarchy
into an equivalent flat list of projects that Eclipse can work with.<br>


<h3><a name="a15"></a>I imported some Gradle projects but can't find
them in my workspace
folder on disk, where are they?</h3>


They are still in the same place they were before you imported them.
The import wizard does not actually copy any files into the STS/Eclipse
workspace folder. Instead it creates a linked representation. Each
project in your workspace (as shown inside STS) actually points to
the original project location on disk where you imported it from. The
reason why we do this is because we want to maintain the underlying
file system structure (which determines the Gradle
project/sub-project) hierarchy. At the same time, to satisfy Eclipse,
we
need to map these nested projects onto a flat list of Eclipse projects.
Using a linked representation it is possible to have both a nested
structure on disk and a flattened representation inside the Eclipse
workspace at the same time. See also the question above "<a href="#why_flat">Why is my project hierarchy flattened</a>?"<br>


<h3><a name="a16"></a>Why doesn't the Gradle import wizard have a "copy
resources into
workspace" option?</h3>


That is because to maintain the project/sub-project relationship we
always use
a linked project representation. Read the answer to the previous two
questions also for more of an explanation why we do this.<br>


<h3><a name="a17"></a>Where can I ask more questions?</h3>


If you have questions about the STS Gradle tooling, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>
is a good place
to ask.
<br>

If you have questions about Gradle, please consult the <a href="https://discuss.gradle.org/">Gradle Help & Support
page</a>.

<h3><a name="a18"></a>Where can I report a bug?</h3>


If your bug is related to the STS Gradle tooling use the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle/issues">GitHub issue
tracker</a>.<br>

If your bug is related to Gradle itself, please consult the <a
href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues">Gradle Issue tracker
page</a>.<br>

If you don't know for sure which one it is, make your best guess.<br>


<br>



When filing a bug report, please try to be as precise as possible about
how the bug can be reproduced. Good bug reports have a much better
chance of getting fixed. Problems that can't be reproduced by us
will probably not get fixed.<br>


<h3><a name="a19"></a>What is UAA?</h3>


If you haven't installed any STS components before, after you installed
the Gradle tooling and restart Eclipse you will be prompted by Spring
UAA, so naturally you might wonder what it is, why you are being
prompted, and what it means to accept or reject the UAA agreement.<br>


<br>


For details please see the <a href="https://www.springsource.org/uaa/faq">Spring User Agent Analysis
FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://www.springsource.org/uaa/terms_of_use">UAA
Terms of Use</a>.<br>



<br>


From the <a href="https://www.springsource.org/uaa/faq">Spring User
Agent Analysis FAQ</a>: "<span style="font-style: italic;">Spring UAA
helps us gain a better understanding of how people are using Spring
technologies. Of course your privacy is of paramount importance. For
this reason Spring UAA does not operate unless you explicitly authorize
it to, and any data it sends is completely anonymous.</span>". <br>


<br>


One good reason to allow the UAA to collect your data is that if you
are using the STS Gradle tooling, your usage data is an implicit vote
for us to continue developing it.<br>


<h3><a name="a20"></a>Why do I get error "Only exactly one embedded distribution should
be found"</h3>



The cryptic error in 2.7.M1 is masking an earlier error. It is most likely
caused by the fact that you have STS set to use the "Gradle Wrapper's
Default" Gradle distribution, but the wrapper's default is not
compatible with the tooling API. See also <a href="#a9">What versions
of Gradle are supported?</a>.<br>


<br>


To address it, try explicitly specifying a gradle distribution in the
Gradle Preferences page (this will overrride your Gradle wrapper's
default. You can paste in the following URL:<br>


<br>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.0-bin.zip">https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-1.0-bin.zip</a>
<br>
</div>


<br>

Alternatively, you can regenerate your Gradle wrapper to use a more recent
version of Gradle.<br>


<br>


Updating to 2.7.M2 build or the nightly build (see <a href="installation.html">installation
instructions</a>) will slightly improve the error message (returning
the original error from the Gradle API). (See question below :-)<br>


<h3><a name="a21"></a>Why do I get error "No value with key 'distributionUrl' specified
in
wrapper properties file"</h3>


The Gradle tooling API 1.0-milestone-3 raises this error when you are using a Gradle
Wrapper generated with an older version of Gradle. For a workaround see the question above. Also see issue <a href="https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-1527">GRADLE-1527</a>.<br>


<h3><a name="a22"></a>How can I disable the STS Dashboard?</h3>
an (Open the preferences with menu "Window &gt;&gt; Preferences" then under
"Spring &gt;&gt; Dashboard" find the checkbox option "Show Dashboard on
startup" and disable it.<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="a23"></a>Why do I get a warning "Method not found. Please verify that the version of Gradle you
connect to contains method:
HierarchicalEclipseProject.getLinkedResources()"?</span></h3>

This method was added in Gradle-1.0.M4. The error happens when a M4 tooling API is being used with a pre-M4 gradle distribution.<br>

<br>

From STS 2.8.0.M1 onward we are using the Gradle-1.0.M4 tooling API.
However the Gradle distribution the tooling API connects to is determined by your Gradle wrapper or the
Gradle preferences page in STS.<br>

To get rid of the error ensure that you are using a distribution of
Gradle-1.0.M4 or later. (Either change your gradlewrapper.properties,
or set it in the Gradle preferences page).<br>


<br>

Note that for most projects, you can use a M3 distribution without
trouble. STS will catch this error and proceed under the assumption
that there are no linked resources. <br>

This assumption is correct in most cases so the warning can be ignored in most cases.<br>

<br>

A typical case where linked resources <span style="font-weight: bold;">are</span> used (and so you <span style="font-weight: bold;">should </span>switch
to M4) is if your project has a source folder that is located outside
of the project itself (for example a subproject having a source folder
pointing to a location in the parrent project with a relative path such as
"../shared-code".<br>

<h3><a name="a24"></a>Should I run ".\gradlew eclipse" before importing my project(s) into STS?</h3>

Ideally you should not have to. Ideally the import wizard would
configure every aspect of your project correctly by querying the Gradle
Tooling API for the required information. However, in reality, the
Tooling API at this time only provides very limited information (see
above <a href="#a2">What types of projects are supported?</a>). If any
of your projects/subprojects requires natures not in the supported
list, you can try to "fill the gap" by leveraging the generated eclipse
configuration files. This works relatively well because the import
wizard attempts as much as possible not to touch configuration
information that cannot be requested from the Tooling API.<br>


<br>

In versions of the Gradle Tooling distributed with STS 2.8.M1 or prior,
you will likely get duplicated information in "Referenced Libraries"
and "Gradle Dependencies". You can fix this by opening the project's
Build Path Properties page and removing the referenced library entries.<br>

<br>

In version 2.8.M2 this step is no longer required because the raw
library class path entries will be automatically removed when the
Gradle Nature is installed onto your project(s).<br>
