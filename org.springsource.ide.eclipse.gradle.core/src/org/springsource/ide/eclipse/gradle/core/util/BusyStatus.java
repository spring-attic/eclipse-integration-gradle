/**
 * A class for tracking whether something is busy. Allows clients to register 'start' and
 * 'stop' events. The status will be considered 'busy' as long as more starts have been
 * received than stops. Clients should take extreme care to ensure they release their
 * busy lock. I.e. any call to 'start' must be balanced by a call to stop, even if
 * the client is terminated by some exception. 
 * <p>
 * Note: java.util.concurrent has ReadWriteLock which does something similar and *could* be
 * used here, except that it has some constraints built-in that locks must be acquired and
 * released by the same thread. Our use case acquires a lock when a Job is created and
 * releases it when this Job terminated. Thus by definition it doesn't meet the requirement
 * (The thread creating the Job is different from the thread the Job itself runs on).
