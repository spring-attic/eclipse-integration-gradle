	 * Note that the modelmanager makes a 'best effort' attempt to satisfy multiple concurrent build requests 
	 * on the modelmanager efficiently. I.e. if it can be determined that two requests are really asking for
	 * the same model than the build manager will only forward a single build request to the model builder and
	 * attempt to use its result to satisfy both requests.

	 * In some scenarios this 'best effort' may fail. So implementors must assume the worst and either 
	 * ensure their implementation allows for concurrent builds or provide a synchronization mechanism.
