Documentation and all other tangible items in your possession or control that 
are proprietary to or contain Confidential Information.  From time to time, 
VMware may change the terms of this EULA.  VMware will notify you of such

its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than 
reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information.

DAMAGES.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF 
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

6.  WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION,

ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

contrary to law the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full 
force and effect.
