Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright\n\
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided\n\

\n\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,\n\
that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial\n\
revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,\n\
as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this\n\
License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable\n\
from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work\n\
and Derivative Works thereof.\n\
\n\
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the\n\

\n\
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n\
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n\

\n\
2. Grant of Copyright License.\n\
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor\n\
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\n\
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare\n\
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and\n\
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\
\n\
3. Grant of Patent License.\n\
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor\n\
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\n\
royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent\n\
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and\n\
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those\n\
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily\n\
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of\n\
their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)\n\
was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity\n\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n\
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted\n\
to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date\n\
such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
4. Redistribution.\n\
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works\n\
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or\n\
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works\n\
     a copy of this License; and\n\
\n\
  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n\
     that You changed the files; and\n\
\n\
  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that\n\
     You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\n\
     notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices\n\
     that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of\n\
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part\n\
     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,\n\
     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display\n\
     generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party\n\
     notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for\n\
     informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You\n\
     may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that\n\
     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text\n\
     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices\n\
     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own\n\
     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional\n\
     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or\n\
     distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works\n\
     as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the\n\
     Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
5. Submission of Contributions.\n\
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally\n\
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be\n\
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional\n\
terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall\n\
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may\n\
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
6. Trademarks.\n\
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,\n\
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for\n\
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\n\
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\n\
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on\n\
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either\n\
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or\n\
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR\n\
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks\n\
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
8. Limitation of Liability.\n\
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\n\
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n\
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,\n\
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,\n\
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\n\
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to\n\
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n\
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised\n\
of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\n\
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may\n\
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\n\
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with\n\
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of\n\
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and\n\
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims\n\
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such\n\
warranty or additional liability.\n\

        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n\
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n\
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n\
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n\
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n\
or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n\
Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n\
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n\
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n\
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n\
    object code form.\n\
\n\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n\
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n\
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n\
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\n\
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n\
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n\
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n\
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\n\
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\n\
    se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n\
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n\
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n\
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n\
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\n\
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n\
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\n\
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\n\
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
    license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\
under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n\
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n\
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n\
        for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n\
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n\
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n\
        party; and\n\
\n\
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\n\
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
        software exchange.\n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n\
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright\n\
    notices contained within the Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n\
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\n\
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\n\
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\n\
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any\n\
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n\
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\n\
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\n\
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n\
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n\
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\n\
claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n\
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement\n\
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\n\
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\n\
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n\
litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\n\
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\n\
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\n\
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\n\
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement\n\
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve\n\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\n\
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\n\
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to\n\
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\n\
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect\n\
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\n\
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\n\
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\n\
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n\
under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\n\
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\n\
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\n\
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\

\n\
3. Distribution Obligations.\n\
\n\
3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\
\n\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n\
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\n\
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n\
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make\n\
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in\n\
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n\
for software exchange.\n\
\n\
3.2. Modifications.\n\
\n\
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed\n\
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your\n\
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient\n\
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\
\n\
3.3. Required Notices.\n\
\n\
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies\n\
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter\n\
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered\n\
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n\
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
\n\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\
\n\
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n\
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\n\
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n\
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only\n\
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n\
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n\
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n\
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n\
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n\
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\
\n\
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n\
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\n\
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n\
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n\
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\n\
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If\n\
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n\
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n\
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\n\
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n\
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n\
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.6. Larger Works.\n\
\n\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n\
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\n\
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n\
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License. \n\
\n\
4.1. New Versions.\n\
\n\
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n\
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n\
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n\
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n\
modify this License.\n\
\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n\
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n\
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n\
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it\n\
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent\n\
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n\
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n\
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n\
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available\n\
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n\
the license steward.\n\
\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\n\
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of\n\
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references\n\
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license\n\
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the\n\
license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\
\n\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\n\
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE\n\
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n\
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n\
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST\n\
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n\
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION. \n\
\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n\
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n\
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n\
this License shall survive.\n\
\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n\
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\n\
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is\n\
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software\n\
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n\
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)\n\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\n\
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n\
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\n\
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60\n\
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\n\
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such\n\
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n\
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a\n\
written agreement with Participant.\n\
\n\
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n\
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n\
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by\n\
any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n\
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER\n\
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n\
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n\
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n\
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES\n\
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n\
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\n\
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO\n\
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS\n\
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
\n\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\n\
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\n\
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and\n\
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in\n\
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n\
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End\n\
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n\
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any\n\
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government\n\
rights in computer software under this License.\n\
\n\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n\
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\n\
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n\
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n\
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to\n\
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n\
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to\n\
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located\n\
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within\n\
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,\n\
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\n\
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n\
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any\n\
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n\
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n\
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and\n\
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise\n\
